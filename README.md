# Urban Grocers – API Testing Project 

This repository contains API testing artifacts developed during a QA Bootcamp project for **Urban Grocers**.  
The main goal of this project is to validate backend business rules, input validation, and delivery logic through REST API testing.

All tests were executed using **Postman**, with a focus on real-world scenarios related to order delivery, pricing calculation, and product management.

## Project Scope

The API testing scope includes:

- Delivery availability validation
- Delivery cost calculation based on weight and service type
- Input validation for product quantity
- Error handling and HTTP status code validation

---

## Test Cases

- A complete set of API test cases is available in an **Excel file**, which contains:
  - Detailed test scenarios
  - Input data
  - Expected results
  - Validation rules

This Excel file is provided for full traceability and reference to the executed tests.

## Bug Reports

Identified issues were documented and organized in the **bug-reports** folder.

Each bug report includes:
- Preconditions
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected result
- Actual result
- Environment information

All bugs were originally reported and tracked in **Jira**, where:
- Request and response payloads
- Screenshots and additional evidence
are attached for each issue.
